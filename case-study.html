                Problem
            </h3>
            <h4>
                As a learning fullstack developer, I needed to know React, Angular and the backend that suppport the two.  These are the two stacks that are currently
                popular:  MERN and MEAN.  Creating two apps using same backend allowed me to compare and contrast the two systems.
            </h4>

            <h3> 
                Goal
            </h3>
            <h4> 
                Objective: <br>
                Create two fullstack apps which allow a user to register, login, look at all movies, create their own "favorite" movie list and modify their user details.
                <br><br>
                Roles<br>
                Full Stack developer, UI / UX designer with help from React-Bootstrap and Angular Material
                <br><br>
                Scale<br>
                The goal was 6 weeks working part-time.  It was accomplished in a little over 5 weeks.
                <br><br>
                Tools and Skills<br>
                Node.js using Visual Studio utilizing MongoDB with Angular / React frontends hosted on Heroku, Github and eventually AWS

                MongoDB, Express using Node.js and implementing Passport, bcrypt and JWT.
                I used Postman to check my endpoints / fetch methods and verify that all the security was working.
            <br><br>
                Challenges<br>
                This project allowed for the security to be copy and pasted for most parts.  However, I wanted to understand what was going on and that made things
                very difficult.  The rest came fairly easily.  The hardest part was learning the new material.  There were few bugs which were due to my trying to learn the 
                system.  
            <br><br>
                Key Takeaways<br>
                It is important to future-proof as much as possible.  The structure of the database was poor and I didn't catch this until the project was complete.
                The database was a mistake that should have been addressed from the start.

                React, React-Bootstrap, Angular, Angular Material, Node.js.<br>
                I used Powershell as well as Visual Studio.  There was a point where I needed to update the backend which required Postman to find the error.

            <br><br>
                Challenges<br>
                Learning JSX and TypeScript were difficult at first, but soon became easier.  There were some bugs that happened with useState and I didn't know
                how to initially use useEffect.  There were some deployment issues with the Angular version that were solved with help from the Discord community.  
                React had some major bugs that came from trying to group components.  All of those were resolved with a conversation with ChatGPT.
                <br>One of the harder challenges was dealing with high-latency networks.  I needed to create a frontend to "hide" this and then update if there were 
                any timeout errors.  
            <br><br>
                Key Takeaways<br>
                After looking at other projects that were similar to my own, mine was visually poor but the feel of it was much better.  Especially when dealing with 
                favorite and unfavoriting movies.  The visuals need someone qualified in UI / UX, but the coding behind the scenes showed my expertise in design.
                <br><br>
                In helping to get to the end product, having tools like ChatGPT and the Discord community were much better than the old style of trudging 
                through Google and Stack Overflow.  Using the css libraries were much better than having to make my own css.  However, I feel that I should have relied 
                more on React-Bootstrap.

                Conclusion and Final Remarks
            </h3>
            <h4>
                React and Angular, while capable of achieving the same goal, take different approaches. 
                <br><br>
                React allowed for more freeform development, enabling me to express my personal coding style. In contrast,
                Angular imposed an opinionated structure.
                <br><br>
                In a collaborative setting, I found Angular to be the preferable choice. Its code structure led 
                to easy comprehension and would aid with collaboration with team members.
                <br><br>
                When working solo, React would be my go-to. Its flexibility granted me the freedom to code using my own style 
                allowing for a more personalized development experience. As my ability in React grew, so did my ability
                to make the code more readable. 
                <br><br>
                Both React and Angular offered unique advantages.  The opportunity to create the same app using both 
                was invaluable in gaining a comprehensive understanding of their strengths and nuances.
