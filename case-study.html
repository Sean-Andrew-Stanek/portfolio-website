                The Context
            </h3>
            <h4>
                In September of 2023, I finally took the step to move away from my second-love of education to re-pursue my first;
                coding.  The world of JavaScript was new.  I had written C# in Unity.  I learned Java and C in college.  
                But, this was new.

                My use of libraries was limited to Unity.  My bootcamp told me of different libraries and frameworks which intigued
                me.  Two of the biggest JavaScript libraries / frameworks are Angular and React and the projects assigned would 
                have me making a movie API, a front-end for Angular and another for React.  I knew they were different.  How different could they be?
                
                tldr: I learned they are very different.
            </h4>

            <h3> 
                The Plan
            </h3>
            <h4> 
                Objective: Learn the difference between a MERN (React) stack and a MEAN (Angular) stack and have
                two full-stack apps for my portfolio to showcase my learned skills.

                <ul>Strategic Development:
                    <li>
                        Create a backend

                Backend - MongoDB, Express using Node.js
            </h3>
                <h4>
                    Coming into the course, I had extensive experience using databases and spreadsheets - years of teaching
                    and organizing student data.  We were initially shown SQL, which I liked.  However, the future is in 
                    NoSQL so using this was a priority in my learning experience.
                    
                    Endpoints were new.  Express was new.  MongoDB was new.  But as a Westerner living in the East,
                    new was normal.  Adaptation was easy and this project was easier than expected.  As it was more code 
                    than presentation, it was clinical and precise without need to adhere to UI / UX style.  

                    Postman taught me how to access my API without a front-end.  I implemented a JWT authentication using 
                    passport.  This was probably the most interesting part.  

                    I grew up in the wild west time of the internet when maleware was a way of life as were popup windows.  
                    Learning how modern security works was really interesting and I spent a lot of time trying to go beyond
                    understanding the simple function calls.
                    
                    The hardship in the lesson came from my ignorance.  I didn't use ChatGPT to check for errors and the old
                    ways of solo coding without AI assistance is outdated.  What should have taken me a week instead took
                    me more as I had not adapted to modern coding strategies.

                    Completion time: 10 days.
                </h4>
            <h3> Frontend - React</h3>
                <h4>
                    React is fun.  

                    The lesson in my bootcamp gave a few examples of React code.  It taught me well, but it was obvious that the 
                    code was meant to teach rather than be used as it was clunky and created hard-to-read code.  
                    
                    Once I convinced myself that it was okay to go "offroad" and use my own style I started to change things around a 
                    lot and make it a lot easier to read.  React is like that, you have quite a bit of freedom to do the things that 
                    you want to do.  The components are modular which gives you one place to look for problems with some exceptions.
                    
                    React felt more like I was coding JavaScript++.

                    There is a debate as to whether React is a framework or a library.  I thought it was a framework when working with
                    JSX: a code style that mimics HTML within a JavaScript setting.  Compared to Angular, I was very wrong.

                    This is where I met my worst arch-nemesis: CORS.  CORS acts like a mail certification saying that the info you 
                    received came from the same right place.  As I helped other people doing the same project that I did, they often
                    had the same problem.  I learned a lot about my nemesis.  It likes to false report.  What may be reported as a CORS
                    error was often something else.  It was only working with the full stack that gave me the ability to trace and fix the
                    problem

                    This is the project that I fell in love with ChatGPT.  There was a four-hour-long-CORS-bug.  I couldn't figure
                    out what was going on.  I felt like I was cheating as I snuck onto ChatGPT, put in a portion of my code and it solved
                    the problem immediately.
                    
                    Since then I've used ChatGPT in every project.  I've broken it multiple times and it has given me a lot of bad information.
                    But it has saved me so much time.  When I was learning C#, Stack Overflow was my ChatGPT.  During this project I could 
                    have found my solution in Stack Overflow, but my time is valuable.  As I survived early GPS telling me to turn right into a lake,
                    my trust but verify attitude worked well with ChatGPT.

                    It took 10 days.  The majority of the time was CORS, a state problem, and wrestling with React-Bootstrap.

                    Frontend - Angular
                </h3>
                <h4>
                    Angular is a framework.  React may be a framework.  It's debatable.  Angular is a framework.

                    Everything is structured.  It feels overengineered and repetitive at times.  While there is freedom in
                    all coding, Angular gives a definitive set of rules.

                    But it was so smooth.  The lessons taught me how to setup Angular.  It taught me how to use Material to make a 
                    modal and then a bit of two-way binding.  That's it.  The rest of the code you see was me, ChatGPT and a little help
                    from the Angular Discord community.  

                    It was during this project, though, that my family got sick.  I was up until 4am every night with my children and up at 
                    7am to teach my kindergarten class.  I don't think I could have done this with React.  Angular is so structured and so 
                    formulaic.  

                    CORS wasn't a problem this time.  As such, I was able to use the extra time to flair a bit with the profile.

                    There is still a lot to be done when it comes to CSS.  This is probably something that I would have to call in a favor to 
                    someone as the images still don't like to size correctly.  But my goal was to display my ability to use Angular so that I could
                    understand the difference.  That goal was accomplished.

                    The time was fourteen days.  Family sickness slowed the schedule and my seven-day week was not sustainable.  I also setup
                    for a new backend Express app to restructure my database in that time and branched my api to deal with the new structure along with 
                    retaining compatability.

                <h3>
                    Conclusion
                </h3>
                <h4>
                    React and Angular, while capable of achieving the same goal, take different approaches. 
                    
                    React allows for more freeform development, enabling me to express my personal coding style. In contrast,
                    Angular imposes a certain structure, demanding a specific way of doing things.
                    
                    In a collaborative setting, I find Angular to be the preferable choice. Its code structure is leads 
                    to easy comprehension and helps collaboration with team members.

                    When working solo, React is my go-to. Its flexibility grants me the freedom to code using my own style, 
                    allowing for a more personalized development experience. As my ability in React grew, so did my ability
                    to make the code more readable. 
                    
                    Both React and Angular offer unique advantages and the opportunity to create the same app using both 
                    was invaluable in gaining a comprehensive understanding of their strengths and nuances.
