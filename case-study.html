<!--                 <h4>
                    Coming into the course, I had extensive experience using databases and spreadsheets - years of teaching
                    and organizing student data.  We were initially shown SQL, which I liked.  However, the future is in 
                    NoSQL so using this was a priority in my learning experience.
                    <br><br>
                    Endpoints were new.  Express was new.  MongoDB was new.  But as a Westerner living in the East,
                    new was normal.  Adaptation was easy and this project was easier than expected.  As it was more code 
                    than presentation, it was clinical and precise without need to adhere to UI / UX style.  
                    <br><br>
                    Postman taught me how to access my API without a front-end.  I implemented a JWT authentication using 
                    passport.  This was probably the most interesting part.  
                    <br><br>
                    I grew up in the wild west time of the internet when maleware was a way of life as were popup windows.  
                    Learning how modern security works was really interesting and I spent a lot of time trying to go beyond
                    understanding the simple function calls.
                    <br><br>
                    The hardship in the lesson came from my ignorance.  I didn't use ChatGPT to check for errors and the old
                    ways of solo coding without AI assistance is outdated.  What should have taken me a week instead took
                    me more as I had not adapted to modern coding strategies.
                    <br><br>
                    Completion time: 10 days.

                    React is fun.  
                    <br><br>
                    The lesson in my bootcamp gave a few examples of React code.  It taught me well, but it was obvious that the 
                    code was meant to teach rather than be used as it was clunky and created hard-to-read code.  
                    <br><br>
                    Once I convinced myself that it was okay to go "offroad" and use my own style I started to change things around a 
                    lot and make it a lot easier to read.  React is like that, you have quite a bit of freedom to do the things that 
                    you want to do.  The components are modular which gives you one place to look for problems with some exceptions.
                    <br><br>
                    React felt more like I was coding JavaScript++.
                    <br><br>
                    There is a debate as to whether React is a framework or a library.  I thought it was a framework when working with
                    JSX: a code style that mimics HTML within a JavaScript setting.  Compared to Angular, I was very wrong.
                    <br><br>
                    This is where I met my worst arch-nemesis: CORS.  CORS acts like a mail certification saying that the info you 
                    received came from the same right place.  As I helped other people doing the same project that I did, they often
                    had the same problem.  I learned a lot about my nemesis.  It likes to false report.  What may be reported as a CORS
                    error was often something else.  It was only working with the full stack that gave me the ability to trace and fix the
                    problem
                    <br><br>
                    This is the project that I fell in love with ChatGPT.  There was a four-hour-long-CORS-bug.  I couldn't figure
                    out what was going on.  I felt like I was cheating as I snuck onto ChatGPT, put in a portion of my code and it solved
                    the problem immediately.
                    <br><br>
                    Since then I've used ChatGPT in every project.  I've broken it multiple times and it has given me a lot of bad information.
                    But it has saved me so much time.  When I was learning C#, Stack Overflow was my ChatGPT.  During this project I could 
                    have found my solution in Stack Overflow, but my time is valuable.  As I survived early GPS telling me to turn right into a lake,
                    my trust but verify attitude worked well with ChatGPT.
                    <br><br>
                    It took 10 days.  The majority of the time was CORS, a state problem, and wrestling with React-Bootstrap.

                all coding, Angular gives a definitive set of rules.
                <br><br>
                But it was so smooth.  The lessons taught me how to setup Angular.  It taught me how to use Material to make a 
                modal and then a bit of two-way binding.  That's it.  The rest of the code you see was me, ChatGPT and a little help
                from the Angular Discord community.  
                <br><br>
                It was during this project, though, that my family got sick.  I was up until 4am every night with my children and up at 
                7am to teach my kindergarten class.  I don't think I could have done this with React.  Angular is so structured and so 
                formulaic.  
                <br><br>
                CORS wasn't a problem this time.  As such, I was able to use the extra time to flair a bit with the profile.
                <br><br>
                There is still a lot to be done when it comes to CSS.  This is probably something that I would have to call in a favor to 
                someone as the images still don't like to size correctly.  But my goal was to display my ability to use Angular so that I could
                understand the difference.  That goal was accomplished.
                <br><br>
                The time was fourteen days.  Family sickness slowed the schedule and my seven-day week was not sustainable.  I also setup
                for a new backend Express app to restructure my database in that time and branched my api to deal with the new structure along with 
                retaining compatability.

                React and Angular, while capable of achieving the same goal, take different approaches. 
                <br><br>
                React allowed for more freeform development, enabling me to express my personal coding style. In contrast,
                Angular imposed a opinionated structure.
                <br><br>
                In a collaborative setting, I found Angular to be the preferable choice. Its code structure led 
                to easy comprehension and would aid with collaboration with team members.
                <br><br>
                When working solo, React would be my go-to. Its flexibility granted me the freedom to code using my own style 
                allowing for a more personalized development experience. As my ability in React grew, so did my ability
                to make the code more readable. 
                <br><br>
                Both React and Angular offered unique advantages.  The opportunity to create the same app using both 
                was invaluable in gaining a comprehensive understanding of their strengths and nuances.
